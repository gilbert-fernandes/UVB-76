Let's get things straight.

I do not give a fuck about your feelings. Fuck your feelings.

Free speech is the first rule.
If that free speech means insulting and shocking, all the better.
Keep your head in your fucking hole if you're a precious snowflake and you don't want to be offended.

You have no right not to be offended.

Until you have shown technicall skill and being good, you will have no respect from me.
Respect is earned. Until it has been, you will get none.

If you believe in equality, I do not.

Welcome to the real world.

And fuck you. Because if you came to read this piece of shit, it probably means you're one of those
low skill, low IQ, hiding behind protections person and I don't want you anywhere within 10 miles of
me.

People that believe in code of conducts are weak.

No ones gives a fuck about your poor feelings and how hard life has been to you.

You don't see poor gazelles try to speak with the lion trying to kill them in nature, do you ?

The world is a harsh place. Either get stronger, or sonner or later, someone will crush you down.

Grow a pair (male, female, whatever you are : grow a pair and act like you got one of lava).
